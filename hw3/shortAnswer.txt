1. In my case, you would get some weird perspectives on the image as well as
   some interesting lighting.

Troubles I ran into:
The biggest problem for me was understanding what to do. I, for one, was stuck
on Part 2 for a long time because of what the spec said to do for that part. It
said I needed to change the direction of the ray but I later found out that it
was the resolution I needed to change. Conceptually, I don't think this was very
hard to do, but I think it just wasn't very clear based on the spec. Also, I
don't know how long it took for other people, but my image for Part 2 took 16
hours to finish rendering, which seems like an extremely long time. My main
concern and trouble was with Part 3. I wasn't able to get that working properly
at all, though at least I was told that theoretically everything was right. I
have submitted my best attempt, which is just a black screen
